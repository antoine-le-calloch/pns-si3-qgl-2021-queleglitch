# Projet SI3-QGL Polytech Nice Sophia

# Introduction
This project of 4 month is the creation of a computerized version of a boat race by
team. Each team being at the head of a crew of sailors who must carry out
actions on the different elements of the boat in order to best pilot the ship.
we have created a program which, depending on external events, acts on the sailors. 
The goal is to finish first in a race against the other groups in the class. 
A different race being carried out every week for 4 months with more and more external events.
