Branching Strategy : GitHub Flow

We have chosen the GitHub flow, we think that is the best solution for our team and for this project.
It's a compromise between the Git Flow and GitLab Flow.

On the one hand, git flow it's too heavy to implement for our project. It would require a lot of time for established it.
On the other hand, GitLab flow it's too unstable, it would require a lot of time to fix the eventual bugs.

Finally, GitHub Flow, correspond to the requirements of this project, 
because each week, a production is delivered and each week represents a feature.
With GitHub Flow each new feature would be a branch and when the feature would be well added and tested it will be delivered for the week in question.
